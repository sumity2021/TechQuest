def generate_challenge_with_ai(difficulty: str, subject: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:

    Your task is to create ONE multiple-choice coding question.

    Input parameters:
    - Subject: {subject}
    - Difficulty: {difficulty} (easy, medium, or hard)

    Question requirements:
    1. The question MUST strictly belong to the given subject.
    - Example: If subject is "DSA", use topics like sorting, searching, stacks, queues, etc.
    - Example: If subject is "SQL", use queries, joins, window functions, etc.
    - Example: If subject is "OS", use scheduling, deadlocks, memory management, etc.
    2. Difficulty meaning:
    - Easy: basic syntax, simple logic, common concepts
    - Medium: intermediate algorithms, data structures, or features
    - Hard: advanced algorithms, optimization, or design patterns
    3. All 4 options must be realistic and plausible â€” only ONE correct.
    4. The correct answer must be at the given index in "correct_answer_id" (0-based).
    5. The explanation must be detailed and formatted in valid HTML.
    6. The question title must include the title in an HTML heading tag (e.g., <h3>).

    Output format:
    Return ONLY valid JSON in the following structure:
    {{
        "title": "<h3>Title of the question</h3><p>Full question description here</p>",
        "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
        "correct_answer_id": 0,
        "explanation": "<p>Detailed explanation of why the correct answer is correct and why others are wrong with paragrapgh in p tag </p>"
    }}
    Do NOT include any text outside of the JSON.
